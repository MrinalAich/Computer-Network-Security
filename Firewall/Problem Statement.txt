Firewall Assignment -

Task 1 – 

Creating a simple Firewall using Socket Programming 
----------------------------------------------------

Implement a simple firewall with two network interface cards connecting to the external network (Internet) and the internal network 
that you secure. In the socket programing, we used read() for capturing packet.

What do you do to let a packet go through the firewall from the outside to inside?
In this stage, you may hardcode a simple rule set.

The network topology that you use may be 3 VMs that are interconnected like {Host1 – Firewall – Host2}.
Also, the mode of firewall operation maybe a router (visible) or a bridge (invisible from hosts).

Task 2 – 

Extending the rule set and its operation on Firewall 
-----------------------------------------------------

Extend the supported rule set at least upto layer 4 including 
MAC, IPv4 IPv6, ICMP for IPv4/v6, TCP/UDP on top of the firewall developed for Task 1. 

Instead of hardcoding the rule set, use a better way for updating the rule set without terminating the process of Firewall.
You may think of Interactive CLI, REST API or something.

As the operation of rule set, “Add”, “Delete”, “Update” and “Show Statistics” for a rule must be implemented.

Your firewall must support the aggregation of a rule set, such as prefix or the range of port numbers. 


Task 3 – 

Performance examination and improvement 
-----------------------------------------


How do you tell the performance of your implementation?

How much packet per second can your implementation handle (PPS)?

Do you see any change of performance if drop or pass the packet?

What happens if you have 10, 50 or 100 rules and the packets are equally matching the filtering rules?

What happens if you increase the number of matching fields in a filtering rule, say MAC address only or Prefix/Port/Proto combination?    

Generate the controlled or random traffic, and benchmark the system. 

Show the benchmarking result as the proper graph with legend, description of each axis and unit.

[You must clarify which traffic generator you use under what kind of configuration for collecting data.]


Task 4-a -

 Improving the firewall performance 
 -----------------------------------
Given the benchmarking result, how do you improve the firewall performance? 

Explain how, implement it, and benchmark it again so that you can show the evidence of betterment. 

Under what kind of condition does your solution work nice? 
Is it an almighty solution or specific to some particular situations? 




Task 4-b - 

Detecting attacks in the network using Firewall 
-------------------------------------------------

Extend your firewall to detect attacks, such as DoS/DDoS, Port Scan, Cache Poisoning of unsecure protocol like ARP.
Pickup at least one attack and explain what the attack is and how your firewall detects it. 

Then, implement the detection mechanism on your firewall.
The detection mechanism must be demonstrated based on the emulated attacks in your testbed.

You must clarify which traffic generator or attacking tool you use under what kind of configuration for creating the emulated attacks.
